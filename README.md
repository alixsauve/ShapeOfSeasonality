# Simulating the dynamics of predator-prey communities undergoing seasonal forcing

This repository share MATLAB scripts associate to the *Journal of Theoretical Biology* paper:
[The effect of seasonal strength and abruptness on predatorâ€“prey dynamics.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110175) (2020) Sauve A.M.C., Taylor R.A., Barraquand F. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 491, 21 April 2020, 110175.

Each script from `Mains` corresponds to the simulations run to draw one figure of the manuscript. They call for various functions stored in `Functions`.
